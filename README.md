# Microsoft SQL Server And TSQL Course For Beginners

All of the script contents are in this repository.

The scripts have been written as part of my course on how to learn T-SQL on Udemy.

Note: The AdventureWorks2017 database is just included in this repository since it is used as part of my course, however it is not something I made. The credit goes to the following source: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15

The reason why I decided to include it in this repository is because that is the exact version I have used in the course. If you download it from the Microsoft website and see odd results - it might be because it was updated so try the version uploaded here since that is the exact version used in the course.
